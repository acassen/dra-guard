 * Soft:        The main goal of dra-guard is to provide robust and secure
 *              extensions to DRA feature (Diameter Routing Agent). DRA are
 *              used in mobile networks in order to redirect users terminals
 *              to their HPLMN in Roaming situations. DRA-Guard implements a
 *              set of features to manipulate and analyze Diameter payloads
 *              via a Plugin framework and a built-in Route-Optimization
 *              feature.
