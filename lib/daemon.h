 * Soft:        The main goal of dra-guard is to provide robust and secure
 *              extensions to DRA feature (Diameter Routing Agent). DRA are
 *              used in mobile networks to route Diameter traffic between
 *              mobile network equipments, like at Roaming interconnections.
 *              DRA-Guard implements a set of features to manipulate and
 *              analyze Diameter payloads via a Plugin framework and a
 *              built-in Route-Optimization feature.
